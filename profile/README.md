## üí° What is `alphabench`?

**`alphabench`** is an AI-native, conversational platform designed to accelerate the entire lifecycle of quantitative research and development. It fundamentally reinvents the quant workflow by integrating a powerful **Agentic AI** with a secure, browser-based **Jupyter Notebook** environment.

Instead of writing boilerplate code, researchers can express complex ideas in natural language. The `alphabench` agent understands the intent, discovers relevant data, writes and executes Python code, and presents results through a rich, interactive interface.

### Key Features:
* ü§ñ **Natural Language to Code:** Go from idea to analysis in seconds. Our agentic workflows generate high-quality Python code for financial modeling, data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`), and more.
* üìà **Interactive Data Visualization:** Move beyond static plots. Render dynamic financial charts with TradingView, enabling deep visual analysis of time-series data.
* üìä **Professional Backtesting Analytics:** Instantly generate comprehensive performance **tearsheets** for your trading strategies, complete with industry-standard metrics, an equity curve, and drawdown analysis.
* üîí **Secure "Bring Your Own Data" (BYOD):** Connect and query your proprietary institutional data with confidence. Our RAG-based system allows the AI to securely access your unique datasets and research documents without ever training on them.
* reproducible-research **Reproducible & Auditable:** Every analysis generates a clean Jupyter Notebook, providing a complete, transparent audit trail essential for compliance, collaboration, and rigorous scientific validation.

## üéØ Who is `alphabench` For?

`alphabench` is built for the demanding environment of modern finance. Our platform empowers professionals who need to move quickly and accurately, bridging the gap between data and decision-making.

* **Quantitative Analysts ("Quants"):** Drastically reduce time spent on data wrangling and coding. Focus on alpha generation and model innovation.
* **Portfolio Managers:** Ask complex questions about risk, exposure, and performance without needing to write a single line of code.
* **Financial Data Scientists:** Leverage a powerful, AI-accelerated environment to build and test sophisticated machine learning models on financial data.
* **Investment & Research Teams:** Collaborate on a unified platform that makes research auditable, reproducible, and easy to share.

We serve organizations where data is the moat, including **Hedge Funds, Asset Management Firms, Investment Banks, and Proprietary Trading Desks.**

## üöÄ Our Mission

The world of finance is drowning in data but starved for insight. The quantitative research lifecycle is powerful but often fragmented, slow, and constrained by technical barriers.

**Our mission at `alphabench` is to democratize access to sophisticated quantitative analysis and 10x the productivity of financial professionals.**

We aim to build the definitive **AI copilot for finance**, a platform that not only writes code but acts as a true research partner. By seamlessly integrating agentic AI with the robust, transparent foundation of the Jupyter ecosystem, we are building the next generation of tools for financial R&D.
